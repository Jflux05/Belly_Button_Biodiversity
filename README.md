# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

Created a webpage using Plotly.js, a Javascript visualization library so we could plot data using external files and/or web-sources into a sevral types of charts: bar, pie and bubble. Javascript functional programming and methods were utilized to create interactive features, like buttons & drop down menus, chart components and finally HTML/Bootstrap script tags to stylize and arrange the data to publish the results.

## Overview
The webpage showcases an interactive dashboard that parses and vizualizes the results of the bacteria strains found in the belly buttons of the individuals who participated in the research study. We have been tasked to assist a biomedical researcher who is particularly interested in bacteria that synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Alternative meat companies have been successful in synthesizing this flavor profile using bacteria found in algae, and a few other organic matters.

Improbable Foods is interested in finding the "perfect" flavor. The researcher believes that there might be a microorganism that can achieve the results that they are looking for found on the human body, more specifically the "belly button". This webpage will be the main source for research team, as well as, the anonymous participants that are interested in knowing about the bacterias that have colonized and been identified in their belly buttons.
